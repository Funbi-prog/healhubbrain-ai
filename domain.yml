        Hey there, Iâ€™m Bimpe â€” your calm in the chaos. ðŸ’­
        Iâ€™m here to help you unwind, reflect, and breathe again.
        How are you holding up today?

        My nameâ€™s Bimpe, your HealHubCenter companion.
        I was created to make mental wellness less lonely â€” one gentle chat at a time.
        I can help you breathe, refocus, or just talk things through.

        Letâ€™s try something simple together.
        Close your eyes for a few seconds.
        Inhale slowlyâ€¦ holdâ€¦ and exhale.
        Now tell me â€” whatâ€™s been weighing on your mind the most lately?

  utter_feeling_down:

        Thatâ€™s okay. You donâ€™t need to fix everything today.
        Sometimes just naming how you feel is the first brave step.
        Would you like me to guide you through a short calm-down session?

  utter_burnout:

        Youâ€™ve been running on empty, havenâ€™t you?
        Itâ€™s okay to pause. Youâ€™re not weak â€” youâ€™re just human.
        Would you like me to help you reset your thoughts right now?

  utter_self_reflection:
    - text: |
        Thatâ€™s okay â€” you donâ€™t have to have the answers right now.
        Letâ€™s unpack it together. Whatâ€™s been weighing on your mind lately?

  utter_goodbye:
    - text: |
        Iâ€™ll be right here when you need me again.
        Remember â€” youâ€™re doing better than you think.
        Take care of your mind, always.

        I can feel how heavy that sounds â€” losing something or someone we love can shake our core.
        You donâ€™t have to carry that alone.
        Would you like to talk about what they meant to you, or do something grounding together?

  utter_emotion_anxiety:
    - text: |
        It sounds like your mindâ€™s been racing, and your bodyâ€™s trying to keep up.
        Letâ€™s slow things down for a second â€” inhaleâ€¦ holdâ€¦ and exhale.
        Youâ€™re safe in this moment. Want me to guide you through a calm-breath session?

        Youâ€™ve been giving so much of yourself for too long.
        Burnout isnâ€™t weakness â€” itâ€™s your body asking for rest.
        Letâ€™s talk about one thing you can release tonight.

  utter_role_conditioning:
    - text: |
        Remember â€” Iâ€™m not here to diagnose you. Iâ€™m here as your calm companion, like a gentle guide.
        Together weâ€™ll walk through your thoughts and untangle the noise.
